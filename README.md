I will be implementing some machine learning algorithms using c++. The list of algorithms I am going to implement includes but restricted to the following:

=======================================
1. Linear regression
i). Normal equation [done], no need to do normalization
ii). Linear regression using gradient descent, need to perform normalization first
2. Logistic regression
3. Linear SVM
4. Perceptron
5. LASSO
6. Previous linear models using SGD
7. SDGA
8. ASGD

=======================================
1. Non-negative matrix factorization

=======================================
1. kNN
2. Boosted Decision Trees
3. Random Forests
4. Neural Network (not the deep architecture)

=======================================
1. Bayesian Filter
2. Kalman Filter
3. Extended Kalman Filter
4. Gaussian Process

=======================================
1. PCA
2. KPCA
3. Kernal density estimation
